#Backgroud
This is an Internet financial media company that sends out a personalized daily digest email of
links to users, selling ads against this content. The digest email process works as follows:
??? Employees of the company identify articles, often by user submission. Each article has a topic
(e.g. Trading, Taxation, Industry Reports), and a type(e.g. Blog Post, White Paper, Tweet,
Comment).
??? The company collects these links and periodically sends a personalizeddigest emailto users
with links to a set of articles. These digest emails are typically sent a few times a week to each
user, with delivery times typically staggered throughout the day.
??? Users can click through the links they receive to viewthe article.

###The Business Problem
The company cares a great deal about the amount of interaction it has with the recipients of the daily
digest email and they want as many users clicking through the content as possible. The ultimate
health of the business depends on user engagement with high-quality content.
The company makes frequent changes to how they determine the right content to send to users,
and they have prioritized many kinds of content from different sources over time. The company
suspects that different kinds of article topics and types have different levels of engagement for
different users, but have generally adjusted that mix of content through a combination of intuition
and high-level metrics.
Now, the company wants to get serious about data analytics. Your task is to determine if, and how,
the likelihood of a user viewing a link they receive has changed over the three months of data the


###Dataset Schema & Definitions
The first is a gzipped SQLite database and can be downloaded here. The database schema is as
follows:
??? userscontains the user ID and email address for all users, both users who have contributed

??? topicscontains the names of all article topics
??? typescontains the names of all article types

??? email_content has a row for each article link sent to a user
??? email_id is the id of the digest email (which contains multiple article links)
??? user_id references the user who receives the email
??? article_id references an article that the digest email contains a link to
??? send_time is the time (in EST) when the digest email is sent to the user
A second dataset contains clicks on article links by users receiving digest emails. This dataset is a
gzipped apache access log file and can be downloaded here. This file contains user clickstreams: for
each click on an article link by a user, there is a row in the log file. The format of the file is
[%t] "GET /click?article_id=%d1&user_id=%d2 HTTP/1.0" %b %d3
